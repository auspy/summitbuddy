    "description": "AI is reshaping how sovereignty is understood for individuals, communities, and nations. While governments played a major role in building the early internet, private actors have also shaped the digital economy. Today, AI development is largely led by the private sector, raising questions about how to align innovation with broader societal goals. This panel will explore how to build trustworthy infrastructure through public-private alignment and governance approaches that prioritize users and accountability. Key takeaways will be distilled across international policy platforms.",

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence has rapidly achieved technical maturity across its first two developmental levels, yet organizational maturity has not kept pace. This panel examines the critical gap between AI capability and institutional readiness. It will explore how targeted capacity building, across leadership, workforce, governance, and processes, can unlock AI's full value. The discussion focuses on activating impact from the bottom of the value chain, ensuring AI adoption translates into measurable outcomes rather than isolated technological success.",
